                          <p>There’s no length we won’t go to discover the most delicious, interesting, and utterly original coffee signature drinks across this great round earth. Even it means grabbing our passports! </p>
                          <p>
                            This week we’re visiting Deep Coffee Roasters in Marseille, France to check out a signature drink that was so popular it stayed on the menu an extra month. The drink features ingredients imported from Japan like black ginger and hebesu citrus, styled in a contemporary and compelling presentation. We spoke with owner Tony Collins to learn more.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p style="font-style: oblique;">Tell us about your signature drink! What’s in it?</p><br> 
                            <p>It’s pretty straightforward—a mix of black ginger syrup that we import from Japan. This syrup is made with black ginger, Okinawa cane sugar, and hebesu citrus juice, a citrus that’s reminiscent of sudachi but is cultivated in Miyazaki. Black ginger is ginger that has fermented three weeks, becoming 50 times richer in shogaol than fresh or dried ginger. Shogaols are one of the spicy components that can be found in ginger.</p><br>
                            <p>carefully balance and dose these strong flavors with steamed oat milk to get a nice micro-texture and get that smooth and comforting classic latte sensation.</p>  <br>
                            <p style="font-style: oblique;"> us about your signature drink! What’s in it?</p><br>
                            <p>How much is it? <br>

                                6.5 Euros [roughly $7 USD]
                                
                                <br>
                                How long will this drink be on the menu?
                                <br>
                                It should have been for only February but since it was quite a hit we are keeping it on until April.
                                <br>
                                Thank you!

                          <p>While I was doing some research for another post, I got lost down a somewhat obscure rabbit hole (something not unusual for me). I came across some information on a style of coffee most commonly referred to as “Mud Coffee”. It was intriguing. Mud coffee meets the basic definition of a manual brewing method so I felt compelled to head to the brewing coffee manually labs and do a little experimenting. </p>
                          <p>
                            Mud coffee is manual coffee brewing at its most basic. To make it,  combine hot water with ground coffee in a mug or glass. Drink your coffee once it cools and the grounds have (hopefully) sunk to the bottom.
                            <br> It is pretty simple. <br> 
                            There are quite a few origin stories surrounding mud coffee. The Polish, who call it “Kawa Plujka,” claim it was a result of learning to make do with what you have. In Indonesian, it is called “Kopi Tubruk.” They add a little sugar to the mix. People have also referred to Turkish and Greek coffee as mud coffee, although they use an Ibrik and also include sugar. <br>
                            Since brewing mud coffee is about the simplest form of making a cup of coffee, I am not surprise there are a few cultures who claim it’s origin.  <br>
                            For the purpose of this post, I am going to be exploring the Polish, “Kawa Plujka” version. I put my own mark on the recipe by nailing down some important parameters like coffee dosage, water temperature and grind size.

                          <p>The main difference between iced coffee and cold brew is how each drink is prepared. As the names suggest, one is regular coffee poured over ice, while the other is cold the entire time.

                            Cold brew is made by steeping coarse coffee grounds in cold water for 12 to 24 hours.
                            
                            Iced coffee is exactly what it sounds like: regular brewed coffee poured over ice. To make it, you brew hot coffee using any brewing method. You can refrigerate this hot coffee or brew it directly over ice.
                            
                            But what exactly is happening in each of these brewing methods, and how do they result in different flavors? Differences in time and temperature affect the final cup of coffee.
                            </p> <br>
                          <p>
                            The process of drawing flavor from coffee beans is known simply as “extraction,” and this is influenced by countless different factors. Most notable, however, is time. The different flavor compounds in coffee beans are extracted at different speeds, and so the total time spent brewing can have a profound effect on what comes out of the beans.

                            Cold brew is a lengthy steeping method, lasting anywhere from 12 to 24 hours. Because you’re leaving the coffee grounds in the water for so long, you want them to be coarsely ground. If you grind them too finely, you could end up over-extracting the beans, resulting in bitter coffee.

                            Iced coffee is made much more quickly, usually in just a few minutes, so you’ll typically want to use more finely ground beans. This method also relies on another factor: hot water.<br>
                            Temperature is the other big factor in coffee preparation. A good rule of thumb is the hotter the water, the faster the extraction. Think about it this way: if you poured cold water through coffee grounds in a drip coffee machine or pour-over, you’d end up with only slightly brownish water. But leave that cold water in your grounds for hours and you’ll have a flavorful cold brew.

                            That’s why to make iced coffee, you’ll need hot water. To make cold brew, you’ll need cold or room temperature water.

                            <h1 style="padding-top: 20px;">Cold Brew vs Iced Coffee: The Bottom Line</h1>
                            <p>Next time you have to choose between cold brew and iced coffee, you’ll be prepared! Why not explore your options a little and compare the flavors of these unique drinks? Maybe you’ll find that you really prefer one to the other – or maybe you’ll just know that some days you need a cold brew and other days you prefer a delicious iced coffee.
