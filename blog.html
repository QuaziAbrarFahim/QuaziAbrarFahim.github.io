                          <p>There’s no length we won’t go to discover the most delicious, interesting, and utterly original coffee signature drinks across this great round earth. Even it means grabbing our passports! </p>
                          <p>
                            This week we’re visiting Deep Coffee Roasters in Marseille, France to check out a signature drink that was so popular it stayed on the menu an extra month. The drink features ingredients imported from Japan like black ginger and hebesu citrus, styled in a contemporary and compelling presentation. We spoke with owner Tony Collins to learn more.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p style="font-style: oblique;">Tell us about your signature drink! What’s in it?</p><br> 
                            <p>It’s pretty straightforward—a mix of black ginger syrup that we import from Japan. This syrup is made with black ginger, Okinawa cane sugar, and hebesu citrus juice, a citrus that’s reminiscent of sudachi but is cultivated in Miyazaki. Black ginger is ginger that has fermented three weeks, becoming 50 times richer in shogaol than fresh or dried ginger. Shogaols are one of the spicy components that can be found in ginger.</p><br>
                            <p>carefully balance and dose these strong flavors with steamed oat milk to get a nice micro-texture and get that smooth and comforting classic latte sensation.</p>  <br>
                            <p style="font-style: oblique;"> us about your signature drink! What’s in it?</p><br>
                            <p>How much is it? <br>

                                6.5 Euros [roughly $7 USD]
                                
                                <br>
                                How long will this drink be on the menu?
                                <br>
                                It should have been for only February but since it was quite a hit we are keeping it on until April.
                                <br>
                                Thank you!

                          <p>While I was doing some research for another post, I got lost down a somewhat obscure rabbit hole (something not unusual for me). I came across some information on a style of coffee most commonly referred to as “Mud Coffee”. It was intriguing. Mud coffee meets the basic definition of a manual brewing method so I felt compelled to head to the brewing coffee manually labs and do a little experimenting. </p>
                          <p>
                            Mud coffee is manual coffee brewing at its most basic. To make it,  combine hot water with ground coffee in a mug or glass. Drink your coffee once it cools and the grounds have (hopefully) sunk to the bottom.
                            <br> It is pretty simple. <br> 
                            There are quite a few origin stories surrounding mud coffee. The Polish, who call it “Kawa Plujka,” claim it was a result of learning to make do with what you have. In Indonesian, it is called “Kopi Tubruk.” They add a little sugar to the mix. People have also referred to Turkish and Greek coffee as mud coffee, although they use an Ibrik and also include sugar. <br>
                            Since brewing mud coffee is about the simplest form of making a cup of coffee, I am not surprise there are a few cultures who claim it’s origin.  <br>
                            For the purpose of this post, I am going to be exploring the Polish, “Kawa Plujka” version. I put my own mark on the recipe by nailing down some important parameters like coffee dosage, water temperature and grind size.
